## Test simulations

The platform was tested using following test simulations:

- Message publishing simulation
- Create and get client simulation

Purpose of these simulations is to see how responsive platform will be under
heavy loads.

### Message publishing simulation

Messsage publishing simulation sends large number of requests to HTTP adapter
service every second. This test checks how much time HTTP adapter took to 
response to each request.

### Create and get client simulation

Create and get client simulation sends large number of requests to manager
service to create client, and than to retrieve its data. This test checks 
how much time manager service took to response to each request.
